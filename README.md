# UnHungry
JavaScript web app to help hungry people find good food fast.
This application shows you the most relevant, highest quality food venues close to you, based on an input radius and number of venues.

Defaults:
- Radius = 100
- Max Venues = 10

Future improvements:
- Make application fully responsive or mobiles and tablets
- Add star ratings to venues
- Let user log in and save favourite venues

Designed and Created by Joseph Preyer, September 2018.
Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming apps: UnBored, UnLazy and UnSleepy!
